DataMind is a platform that transforms learning and creativity by using AI to deliver personalized study materials and multimedia content. This project develops an AI-powered web application for efficient text extraction from structured and unstructured PDFs, employing OCR, NLP, and machine learning. Our system handles not only the extraction of text from PDFs, but also handles grammar correction, offering a scalable solution for diverse document processing challenges.


**Problem statement: **
         The lack of personalized educational resources limits student engagement and effective learning. Additionally, content creators struggle to produce high-quality multimedia projects efficiently, including storytelling. This gap restricts creativity and innovation in both education and professional development.


**Algorithm used : **
    	 # Transformers
         # Graph Neural Network (GNN)
		 # StoryNet algorithm with Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN)
		 # Grammar checking algorithms


**Architecture : **
